   A group of students launched a rocket and collected pollen samples
   up to about 4000 feet.  They found roughly 50% as much pollen at
   that altitude as in the 1000 foot range.  Their work was based on
   a study by Camtois et al. in 1999 (could not find exact
   reference).

   It seems like this is *the* journal for this kind of research.
   Could we get access?

   They only did samplings at 1.5 and 15 m.  The references in this
   article may be useful.

   This appears to be the article referenced by the Madison West
   Rocketry group.  They specifically used a balloon!  Maximum
   altitude was 600 m (around 2000 ft).  Correlated environmental
   factors with how they influence pollen count at various altitudes.
